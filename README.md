# AirViz-Insight-for-NY-Airbnb

üó∫Ô∏è Objective: Empower clients with strategic recommendations on optimal regions, pricing strategies, and accommodation types for successful Airbnb listings, driven by data-backed insights.

Data Cleaning and Transformation:
Utilized Python and pandas to clean and transform the Airbnb NYC rental dataset, handling missing values and outliers, ensuring data integrity for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Conducted EDA using seaborn and matplotlib to visualize the distribution of prices, analyze relationships between variables such as room type and price, and identify trends in the dataset.

Statistical Analysis and Visualization:
Employed statistical techniques like ANOVA and Tukey's HSD test to analyze significant differences in prices among room types, and visualized the impact of neighborhoods on pricing to derive insights for strategic decision-making.

Reporting and Insights:
Generated reports and visualizations to communicate findings on occupancy rates, seasonal pricing patterns, and neighborhood-wise listing counts, facilitating informed decision-making for stakeholders in the Airbnb marketplace.

This project not only showcased the power of Python and visualization tools but also emphasized the pivotal role of data-backed recommendations in shaping strategic decisions within the hospitality domain.
